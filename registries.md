# Registries

As part of the [Registries of Good Practice project](https://github.com/digipres/registries-of-practice-project), I'm surveying the landscape of 'registries' and related information resources used in digital preservation.

- [PRONOM](/registries/pronom)

The main list of resources is in the [Digital Preservation Awesome List](https://github.com/digipres/awesome-digital-preservation#readme), but some of those items link here to add more detailed context and some historical information.
