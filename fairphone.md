# Fairphone from iPhone

Large collection, so initial transfer failed.

- Don't even really want photos as they are lower quality versions

## WhatsApp

WhatApp link new device as Companion first, so chats can transfer over, then switch SIM. Doesn't go back in time all that far, and doesn't include media.

## Podcasts
