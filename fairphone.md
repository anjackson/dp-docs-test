# Fairphone from iPhone

Large collection, so initial transfer failed.

## Photos

Don't even want iClouded photos as they are lower quality versions.

- Switch off iCloud photos and select 'remove from phone' when asked about whether to download to the phone.
- 10GB of photos remain, as were not messed with by iCloud.
- Manually checked recent photos were on the Mac, via iCloud.
- Connected iPhone to Mac...
- Used Photos, to check if anything appears to need importing.
- Tried to use `Image Capture` to delete all the photos. Didn't seem to work?! Even deleting one photo took ages and then failed.
- Restart iPhone...
- That seemed to help, _Image Capture_ reports 45,235 files (much larger than before, comparable to the whole collection's size) and deleting one worked. Trying to delete all...


## WhatsApp

WhatApp link new device as Companion first, so chats can transfer over, then switch SIM. Doesn't go back in time all that far, and doesn't include media.
